# iOSThirdPartyTools
A sample project for Cocoaheads' presentation (December 6th, 2018)

# Project
The project is a simple table view that displays 5 `aww` posts from this [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/aww). 

Each commit sets up one of the tools that I use when I start a project.  

You'll find most of the informations needed in the commits or in the keynote's author comments.
